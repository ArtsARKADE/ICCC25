### Text data samples

Text samples below are used by TTS to generate rap. The outputs (flow) are then compared to the audio sample. 



### 1. Freestyle rap sample-1 (from audio)  

Think out the box with my flow <br>
I've no fear to tread where no other man go, <br>
No tear to shed when I reap what I sow <br>
You know I speak truth  to the maximum,  <br>
Got these billionaires scared, cos I talk about taxing <br>

### 2. Freestyle rap sample-2 (approximates flow of original)

I break all the rules with my flow <br>
I plant every seed and I watch it all grow <br>
No chains on my feet, I’m ready to go <br>
I speak what I see, let the whole world know <br>
These suits start to sweat cos they'll never scare me <br>

### 3. Eminem ‘Lose Yourself’

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy <br>
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti <br>
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready <br>
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting <br>
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud <br>
